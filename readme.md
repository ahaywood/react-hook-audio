# Quick Start

- Clone the repo
- Install the dependencies using `yarn install`
- View the components in the browser using `yarn storybook`
- Create a unique project token for your Storybook by [signing in to Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/start) and creating a project.
- Run the following command: `npx chromatic --project-token <your-project-token>`. When complete, youâ€™ll see the build status and a link to the published Storybook.
- Test any changes by running `yarn test`
- Build the library using `yarn build`
