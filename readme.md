# Quick Start

- Clone the repo
- Install the dependencies using `yarn install`
- View the components in the browser using `yarn storybook`
- Test any changes by running `yarn test`
- Build the library using `yarn build`
- Publish your package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). ([Additional instructions here](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages))

## Connecting to Chromatic

- Create a unique project token for your Storybook by [signing in to Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/start) and creating a project.
- Run the following command: `npx chromatic --project-token <your-project-token>`.
- When complete, youâ€™ll see the build status and a link to the published Storybook.

## CI/CD

- When you push code to the repo, stories will be published to [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/). _NOTE: There's a little extra setup required to connect to Chromatic. (Detailed below)_
- When code is pushed is pushed to the `main` branch or a new pull request is made, [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) will run.
- When code is pushed Jest unit tests will run. ([for reference](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-jest))

### Setting up Chromatic

- Navigate to your GitHub repository. Click the **Settings** tab, followed by **Secrets** and then **New secret.**
- Create a secret named `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` and paste the token into the value.
  You can find additional information on [Chromatic's documentation](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/github-actions).

# Shout Outs

I used [@Timonwa](https://github.com/Timonwa)'s [Log Rocket: How to Build a Component Library within React and TypeScript](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-build-component-library-react-typescript/#why-build-component-library) and [demo-ui-library](https://github.com/Timonwa/demo-ui-library) as a starting point.
